# Speak at TacoConf Oakland!

Call for proposals for all speakers. To submit a proposal, please open a new Github issue.

Talks should be about food, culture, or any other interesting story or topic you think would be great.

## Talk Acceptance

All talks are still being considered. Talks will be accepted one at a time over the next few months. Because many events are structured in a narrative acceptance happens in the order we fill the narrative.

**You should still submit your talk! We are definitely still accepting them :)**

### Submissions

Create an issue in this repository. You can suggest a talk you'd like to give or one that you would like to see with or without a suggested speaker.

The idea doesn't have to be fully fleshed out and we're here to help.

### Format & Audience

Talks are 20 minutes. There is no time for Q&A after.

All events with speakers are presented as part of a *narrative*. Don't worry about fitting your talk in to specific narrative, that's the job of the curator, and we may add new narratives based on the proposals we get.
